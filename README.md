# Vue.js Learning Path

## Overview
This repository contains my projects and code exercises from the LinkedIn Learning path "Explore Web Development with Vue.js". The learning path consists of three courses that cover fundamental to advanced Vue.js concepts, testing, debugging, and full-stack development.

## Courses Completed
1. **Learning Vue.js** (Instructor: Michael Sullivan, May 2021)
   - Duration: 1h 41m
   - Fundamentals of Vue.js framework
   - Component management
   - Data binding and reactivity
   - Change detection

2. **Vue.js: Testing and Debugging** (Instructor: Fikayo Adepoju, September 2021)
   - Duration: 1h 19m
   - Testing strategies for Vue.js applications
   - Debugging techniques and tools
   - Best practices for maintaining Vue.js code

3. **Vue.js: Creating and Hosting a Full-Stack Site** (Instructor: Shaun Wassell, March 2023)
   - Duration: 4h 31m
   - Building complete full-stack applications
   - Hosting and deployment strategies
   - Connecting Vue.js frontend with backend services

## Skills Acquired
- Building data-driven applications with Vue.js
- Creating secure applications with Vue.js
- Combining Vue.js with other technologies
- Testing and debugging Vue.js applications
- Developing and hosting full-stack Vue.js applications

I'll update the project structure section in the README.md to reflect your branching strategy with chapter-based organization:

## Project Structure
```
Repository Structure:

├── learning-vuejs (branch)
│   ├── chapter-1/
│   ├── chapter-2/
│   ├── chapter-3/
│   └── ...
│
├── testing-debugging (branch)
│   ├── chapter-1/
│   ├── chapter-2/
│   ├── chapter-3/
│   └── ...
│
└── full-stack-site (branch)
    ├── chapter-1/
    ├── chapter-2/
    ├── chapter-3/
    └── ...
```

Each chapter folder contains all code examples and exercises related to that specific chapter in the course. This branching strategy allows for clear separation between the three courses while maintaining a consistent organizational structure within each course.


## Getting Started
